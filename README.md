### ExpenseTracker is a Coursera Django Project in which I work on implementing a Django based web-application to manage Rumi Press's book distribution process which is currently conducted by using excel spreadsheets. 
### The web app involves a CRUD view for books, book categories and a report view for the distribution expenses of books according to their categories. The app also allows importing the data from excel spreadsheet.
