### ExpenseTracker is a Coursera Django Project in which I work on implementing a Django based web-application to manage Rumi Press's book distribution process which is currently conducted by using excel spreadsheets.
### The web app involves a CRUD view for books, book categories and a report view for the distribution expenses of books according to their categories. The app also allows importing the data from excel spreadsheet.
### A book search and a category search functionality are also added in the web application to allow users efficiently search for required books. Authentication system is included in the app to restrict data access to registered users.
